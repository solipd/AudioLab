# AudioLab

A libary of high level Pure Date abstractions with a focus on electroacoustic composition,
live electronics and sound design.

## Installation

To run this software you’ll need to install Pure Data version 0.49 or later. It won’t work
with alternative Pure data distributions, like Pd-extended or Pd-L2ork/Purr-Data.
Pd can be downloaded from https://puredata.info/ 

In Pd go to Preferences→Path...→New... and set the path to the AudioLab directory.
Alternatively, you can use the declare object to set a path relative to the directory of
your patch like [declare -path ../AudioLab].
